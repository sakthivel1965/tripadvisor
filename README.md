# tripadvisor

The TripleAdvisor project is a simple static website built using HTML and CSS, designed to provide travel recommendations and reviews for popular destinations. The website showcases a clean, modern layout that features navigation options, a hero section for user engagement, and a curated list of top travel destinations. The layout is responsive, allowing it to adapt to different screen sizes (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).

Navigation Bar:

The header contains a logo for branding, followed by a menu with links to other sections of the site (Home, Destinations, Travel Tips, and Contact).
The navigation bar is styled to be prominent, with a dark background color and white text.
Hero Section:

The hero section is the first thing users see when they visit the site.
It features a large background image (e.g., scenic view), along with a heading and a tagline that invites users to explore the best travel destinations.
The hero section helps to immediately engage the user and set the tone of the site.
Featured Destinations:

This section showcases three travel destinations with images, titles, and short descriptions.
Each destination card is styled with a white background, rounded corners, and a slight shadow to make it stand out on the page.
The destinations are laid out using a flexbox container for a responsive grid design. This ensures the layout looks great on both larger and smaller screens.
Footer Section:

The footer contains basic copyright information and links to social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
